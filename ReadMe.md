# General Assembly Homework 2 - Matchmaker

Homework assignment #2 for General Assembly's Front End Web Development Boot Camp. The assignment was to "build a modern layout replicating the provided screenshot / solution code as best as possible. The goal is to practice modern principles of CSS layout - manipulating parent and child elements using the box model (padding, border and margin), the display property and flexbox."

Technical Requirements

  

-   Add HTML markup around content, making sure to use elements that make sense semantically
    
-   Add appropriate CSS rules
    

-   Your result doesn’t have to match exactly (especially regarding spacing - padding/margin may vary), but I would like to see the general layout recreated:
    

-   Nav with logo / links on the right
    
-   Element below the nav with centered text
    
-   Background image with element on the right
    
-   Three column view with “Create a Profile” / “Find a Developer” / “Find a Designer”
    
-   Footer
    

-   Colors and fonts are listed in the starter code CSS in comments
